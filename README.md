MATRIXLCD


The Matrix LCD screen is a little LCD screen that has a display area and input buttons. It's a bit fiddly to get set up properly. This library specifically deals with the LK204-7T-1U and lets you change the text, display colour, format, etc., handle input events, and other stuff. If I can find a way to get the screen to behave more consistently, I'll add more interesting stuff to the library. It'd be a great one to have with a raspberry pi or something and that's the end goal.
